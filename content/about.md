G'day! I'm a creative polyglot programmer/engineer, and I'm passionate about computers, how we interact with them, and how they can be used to enable creativity. Welcome to my humble website!

My real name is Mithun, but let's keep that between friends, family and employers. I hark from the distant southern lands of Australia, and currently live in Sweden. (Yes, the temperature differential makes me sick every time I switch hemispheres.)

I've worked with every layer of the stack - from the little electrons racing around my workbench, to software riding high enough for Snoop Dogg to call for advice - and I can be found doing any number of things, including but certainly not limited to:

- game reverse engineering and modification
- open-source development and community management
- low-level and embedded programming
- virtual and augmented reality
- artificial intelligence productionisation
- human-computer interface research

If you'd like to know more about what I've worked on or built, why not check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/philpax)?

I can be contacted via [email](mailto:me@philpax.me), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/philpax.me), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@philpax), or your nearest `@philpax` profile (it's probably me.)
