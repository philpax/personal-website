- part 1 of 2; see [we need a xros]
- based on ideas from [Your Next Mac]
- computing unbound by the physical screens you have available
- any screen you want, anywhere
- overlaid upon virtual spaces or the real world
- this is coming sooner than you think: see Simula One
- video of writing this page in a Quest 2
- where we're at currently
- where we need to be
- we have computers on our face! let's do something with them!

I'll paint a picture of a potential scenario, but note that they may not do this: they've put the computing power of a cutting-edge MacBook on your face, and it is capable of doing everything you'd expect from a computer. To accommodate this, they've adapted macOS for XR, with all that it entails.

All of your existing applications, both macOS and iOS, just work - they're presented in floating windows that you can move around, using hand-tracking and the fingertip controller for haptics. The windows have three-dimensional elements, and they are large and very legible.

You have access to everything you do on your computer, except it surrounds you, it's unconstrained by a screen, and you can take it everywhere. You can see reality underneath, or you can see whatever you want to see.

When you put on this headset, you can be instantly transported to a moving castle, with a colourful medieval world passing you by. You can load up browser windows with the things you're researching, and then slide up a Pages window, just above the keyboard you're using to type. Your very own virtual typewriter springs to life.

and that's before you get to the part where apps can change the reality you're in entirely.

Sit down on your couch, load up Bigscreen: Apple Edition as quickly and easily as launching Netflix on your phone, and invite your friend to join you in a virtual cinema that looks flawless thanks to SharePlay.

Load up Alyx, and capture and stream it with your avatar being composited in in real-time without having to set up three different applications. Do all the things you'd come to expect of PCVR, but on the headset itself, and automatically.

...and then you turn on the passthrough cameras, and realise that reality itself can be changed.  Real-life ad block won't just become a thing, it'll be one of the first things that get released. People can speak to you in another language, and it'll be able to translate them in real-time. Watch music with music visualizers that fill your space and react in mesmerising ways to every element of your favourite song.

Imagine playing S&box outside in a park with friends - a complete physics sandbox where the playing field is all around you, and you can build and destroy whatever you want - or any game you can think of!

The pieces all exist; they just need to be put together, and Apple are well on their way to doing that. They could literally change the world overnight.

tl;dr it'll do for XR what the iPhone did for smartphones
