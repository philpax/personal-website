This website is generated by [paxsite](https://github.com/philpax/philpax.github.io), a bespoke SSG in Rust that generates HTML using `paxhtml`, a JSX-like library. Previously, I was using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), but I was led to build my own after struggling to work within its templating and organisation framework.[^1]

[^1]: No fault of the Zola authors; I'm just a particular kind of guy!

Design inspiration was taken from [Gwern](https://gwern.net/), [Weak Opinions, Strongly Held](https://blog.sulami.xyz/), [Gergely Nagy's former website](https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/), [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com/), [osmarks.net](https://osmarks.net/), [Nora Codes](https://nora.codes/), and more.

The font in use is [Literata v3.103](https://github.com/googlefonts/literata), and [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) are used for the dark/light mode switcher.
